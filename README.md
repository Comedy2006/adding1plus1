# **Adding 1 and 1 together**
## **Project Overview**
Since adding 1 and 1 together turns out to be a complicated task, I tried to make it as simple as possible using the most beginner-friendly language in computer science history: C.

This small project showcases the power of C by adding 1 and 1 together (in the simplest way I could find).

## **Features**

- **Adding two numbers together**: 1 + 1 is hardcoded in the program.
- **The most efficient code the industry has ever seen**: I wanted this to be the most efficient and safest code out there.

## **Technical Details**

### **Core Concepts Demonstrated**

1. **Adding two values together**:
   - The project adds two values (1 and 1) together.
   - Have I ever mentioned that this program adds 1 and 1 together?

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisities**

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following tools available:

- A Computer (preferrably with a Keyboard and Mouse)
- A C Compiler

For anyone wondering: 1+1=2
