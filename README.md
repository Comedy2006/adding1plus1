# **Adding 1 and 1 together**
## **Project Overview**
Since adding 1 and 1 together turns out to be a complicated task, I tried to do it as simple as possible using the most beginner friendly language in Computer Science history: C.

This little project should showcase the power of C by adding 1 and 1 together (in the most simplest way I could find).

## **Features**

- **Adding two numbers together**: 1 + 1 is hardcoded in the program.
- **The most efficient Code the industry has ever seen**: I wanted this to be the most efficient and safest code to be there.

## **Technical Details**

### **Core Concepts Demonstrated**
